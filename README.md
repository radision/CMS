Bootstrap CMS
=============

Bootstrap CMS was created by, and is maintained by [Graham Campbell](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell), and is a PHP CMS powered by [Laravel 5.0](http://laravel.com) and [Sentry](https://cartalyst.com/manual/sentry). It utilises 12 of my packages including [Laravel Core](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Core) and [Laravel Credentials](https://github.com/BootstrapCMS/Credentials). Feel free to check out the [change log](CHANGELOG.md), [releases](https://github.com/BootstrapCMS/CMS/releases), [license](LICENSE), [screenshots](SCREENSHOTS.md), [api docs](http://docs.grahamjcampbell.co.uk), and [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Looking For Version 0.8?

Version 0.8 is currently more stable than this version (0.9), and is available on the [0.8 branch](https://github.com/BootstrapCMS/CMS/tree/0.8). It uses Laravel 4.2 for example, while this version is built on Laravel 5.


## Installation

[PHP](https://php.net) 5.5+ or [HHVM](http://hhvm.com) 3.3+, a database server, and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) are required.

1. There are 3 ways of grabbing the code:
  * Use GitHub: simply download the zip on the right of the readme
  * Use Git: `git clone git@github.com:BootstrapCMS/CMS.git`
  * Use Composer: `composer create-project graham-campbell/bootstrap-cms --prefer-dist -s dev`
2. From a command line open in the folder, run `composer install --no-dev -o`.
3. Enter your database details into `config/database.php`.
4. Run `php artisan app:install` to setup and seed your database.
5. You will need to enter your mail server details into `config/mail.php`.
  * You can disable verification emails in `config/navigation.php`
  * Mail is still required for other functions like password resets and the contact form
  * You must set the contact email in `config/contact.php`
  * I'd recommend [queuing](#setting-up-queing) email sending for greater performance (see below)
6. Finally, setup an [Apache VirtualHost](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/vhosts/examples.html) to point to the "public" folder.
  * For development, you can simply run `php artisan serve`
7. Additionally, you may to setup some of Bootstrap CMS's other features (see below).
  * Some things, like [caching](#setting-up-caching) and [queuing](#setting-up-queing), are disabled out of the box
  * This is to allow Bootstrap CMS to work with minimal setup
  * Also note, without caching asset generation will cause page load delay - to reduce this, I have turned off minification in `config/asset.php` by default


## Setting Up Queuing

Bootstrap CMS uses Laravel's queue system to offload jobs such as sending emails so your users don't have to wait for these activities to complete before their pages load. By default, we're using the "sync" queue driver.

1. Check out Laravel's [documentation](http://laravel.com/docs/master/queues#configuration).
2. Enter your queue server details into `config/queue.php`.


## Setting Up Caching

Bootstrap CMS provides caching functionality, and when enabled, requires a caching server.
Note that caching will not work with Laravel's `file` or `database` cache drivers.

1. Choose your poison - I'd recommend [Redis](http://redis.io).
2. Enter your cache server details into `config/cache.php`.
3. You will probably want to enabled minification in `config/asset.php`.
4. Setting the driver to array will effectively disable caching if you don't want the overhead.


## Setting Up Themes

Bootstrap CMS also ships with 18 themes, 16 from [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com).

1. You can set your theme in `config/theme.php`.
2. You can also set your nav bar style in `config/theme.php`.
3. After making theme changes, you will have to run `php artisan app:update`.


## Setting Up Google Analytics

Bootstrap CMS natively supports [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics).

1. Setup a web property on [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics).
2. Enter your tracking id into `config/analytics.php`.
3. Enable Google Analytics in `config/analytics.php`.


## Setting Up CloudFlare Analytics

Bootstrap CMS can read [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) analytic data through a package.

1. Follow the install instructions for my [Laravel CloudFlare](https://github.com/BootstrapCMS/CloudFlare) package.
2. Remember to add your credentials to `config/cloudflareapi.php`.
3. Bootstrap CMS will auto-detect the package, only allow admin access, and add links to the navigation bar.
